Hi, there! It's imkoga002.
Today, I want to report about "1st Alums Career-Networking Meetup".
First you need to know about our organization. HorizonVertical is a closed community for alums of RyukokuHorizon. RyukokuHorizon is programming club in Ryukoku University. 
Of cource a part of members of RyukokuHorizon is working on Job-Hunting. Then we wanned to support those members for their better carrer-path or even their lives. We've been looking forward to host meetup for students and alums for two years. 

And this marks our very first meetup!!!
