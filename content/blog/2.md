So I Joined it and this is report of it.

At first, I wanna describe HDC:Horizon Developers Conference.
HDC is biggest event of RyukokuHorizon. It was begin in last year, so it was 2nd time.
Last year, we(last year i was leader of RyukokuHorizon) held it as closed event.
I was planned HDC to become significance tech event that a lot of people like alums, teachers, people of other cmmunity, company and of cource member of Rh in the future.
What surprised me, HDC2025 was really evolved. Teachers, lot's of members of other community was joined in this year.

By the way, I make HDC and it's Horizon Developers Conference. But, HDC2025 was Horizon Development Conference. wait! maybe I forgot to hand over it.

Okay, returning main topic. Whatever, HDC2025 was amazing event!
